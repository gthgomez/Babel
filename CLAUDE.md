# CLAUDE.md — Babel (Public Canonical Source)

> **Role**: Entry point for AI sessions in the Babel public repo (`gthgomez/Babel`). This is the **canonical OSS source of truth** for the Babel coding agent. Startup sequence, repo architecture, invariants, high-risk zones, and common task paths.
> For what Babel is and how to invoke it, see [BABEL_BIBLE.md](./BABEL_BIBLE.md).
> For deep technical architecture, see [docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md](./docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md).

> **TL;DR**: You are in the Babel product repo. Don't break the V9 orchestrator, the prompt catalog, or Behavioral OS. Validate changes with `pwsh tools/validate-catalog.ps1`. For CLI code changes, run `cd babel-cli && npm test`.

## Repository Identity

This is the **public, canonical source** for the Babel coding agent (`gthgomez/Babel`). All active product development happens here.

- **Source work**: clone, branch, PR on this repo

**This is "Option A"**: the public repo is fully independent. Private→public write is permanently frozen (remote push disabled, script guarded).

## Repo Layer Architecture

```
User-facing surface (README.md, BABEL_BIBLE.md)
Control plane (prompt layers assembled into instruction stacks):
  00_System_Router/     ← orchestrator + runtime contracts
  01_Behavioral_OS/     ← how the model behaves
  02_Domain_Architects/ ← what the model knows
  02_Skills/            ← reusable technical modules
  03_Model_Adapters/    ← model-specific tuning
  04_Meta_Tools/        ← prompt compiler/tester/auditor
  05_Project_Overlays/  ← per-project context files
  06_Task_Overlays/     ← per-task guidance
Runtime:
  babel-cli/            ← CLI harness, pipeline, TUI
  babel-cli/src/        ← TypeScript source
  babel-cli/dist/       ← compiled output
Support:
  tools/                ← PowerShell automation
  docs/                 ← architecture, plans, status, ADRs
  config/               ← static configuration
  examples/             ← example outputs
  .github/workflows/    ← CI/CD
  LLM_COLLABORATION_SYSTEM/ ← foundational rule documents
  .agents/              ← agent lifecycle rules + skills
```

## Startup Sequence

**On every session start**, this file (CLAUDE.md) is your entry point — it covers invariants, high-risk zones, and common task paths.

**When Babel control-plane work is requested** (`use Babel`, prompt-stack assembly, routing, catalog changes), load:
1. `BABEL_BIBLE.md` — entrypoint, layer model, workflow
2. `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — system contracts and hot paths
3. `prompt_catalog.yaml` — canonical source of truth for prompt versioning and file paths
4. This file — invariants, high-risk zones, special rules, common task paths

## Babel Harness

The TUI provides chat, plan, and deep modes with automatic session tracking, resume, and cost monitoring. For what Babel is and how to launch it, see [BABEL_BIBLE.md](./BABEL_BIBLE.md).

When working on the Babel control plane itself (prompt stack assembly, routing, catalog changes), load the relevant Babel layers per the [Startup Sequence](#startup-sequence) above. Do not improvise the Babel stack from memory.

## Relationship: This File vs babel-cli/CLAUDE.md

| File | Scope | Contains |
|------|-------|----------|
| `CLAUDE.md` (this file) | Whole Babel control plane | Repo invariants, layer architecture, high-risk zones |
| `babel-cli/CLAUDE.md` | babel-cli package only | Coding standards, event-loop rules, testing discipline, chat-mode invariants |

The root CLAUDE.md takes precedence for cross-project rules. `babel-cli/CLAUDE.md` is the authority for CLI-specific coding standards.

## Relationship: Public Repo vs Private Vault

This is the canonical public source for the Babel coding agent. All active product development happens here. Secrets and credentials are managed via environment variables or system credential managers — never committed to this repo.

CI/CD runs on public GitHub Actions workflows. No private infrastructure is referenced or required.

## Critical Invariants

1. **V9 Orchestrator** (`OLS-v9-Orchestrator.md`) is the only live typed runtime lane — preserve its routing contract
2. **Legacy V8 references** are historical compatibility notes only. Do not describe `OLS-v8-Orchestrator.md` as an active fallback unless runtime support is reintroduced in the same change set.
3. **Behavioral OS / Domain Architect separation** — "how the model behaves" vs "what the model knows" must stay strictly separated
4. **Global breaking changes** — edits to `01_Behavioral_OS/` or `RULES_CORE.md`/`RULES_GUARD.md` affect ALL downstream agents across ALL projects
5. **`prompt_catalog.yaml`** is the single source of truth for prompt versioning and file paths — no prompt file is canonical unless listed here
6. **Prompt/runtime co-evolution** — if `babel-cli/src/agentContracts.ts` or any `build*Task` function in `pipeline.ts` is changed, the corresponding prompt file must be updated in the same change set. Runtime-only changes that extend a model contract are incomplete changes.

## High-Risk Zones

- `00_System_Router/OLS-v9-Orchestrator.md`
- `01_Behavioral_OS/*`
- `prompt_catalog.yaml`
- `04_Meta_Tools/OLS-MCC/ols-compiler/SKILL.md`
- `babel-cli/src/schemas/agentContracts.ts` — Zod output contracts; changes here require prompt co-evolution
- `babel-cli/src/pipeline.ts` (`build*Task` functions) — runtime task injection; changes here require prompt co-evolution
- `LLM_COLLABORATION_SYSTEM/RULES_CORE.md` — behavioral foundation for all agents
- `LLM_COLLABORATION_SYSTEM/RULES_GUARD.md` — safety guard for all agents
- `.github/workflows/` — public CI; changes here affect all PRs

## Special Rules

- Never break the V9 Orchestrator input/output JSON contract (primary lane)
- Do not revive or depend on a V8 compatibility lane unless runtime support and tests are added in the same change set
- Never invent prompt files that are not in `prompt_catalog.yaml` unless explicitly asked to author new Babel files
- Never introduce circular dependencies between prompt overlays and meta-tools
- All Domain Architects must follow their respective vX specs
- Maintain strict versioning and path integrity in `prompt_catalog.yaml`
- **Never commit secrets, API keys, tokens, or private paths to this repo** — use environment variables or Windows Credential Manager for credentials. Public CI scans (`gitleaks`, `check-public-content-policy.ps1`) will catch leaks.

## Environment Gotchas (Windows + Git Bash)

These are the most frequent tool failures observed across sessions. Follow them to avoid rediscovering them:

1. **Always use absolute, forward-slash paths in Bash commands.** Windows backslash paths get their backslashes stripped inside bash (`C:\MyProject\...` becomes `C:MyProject...`). Use `C:/MyProject/...` or `/c/MyProject/...`.
2. **Know where you are before `cd babel-cli`.** The npm workspace lives at `<repo-root>/babel-cli/`. `cd babel-cli` fails when the shell is already inside `babel-cli/` or anywhere other than repo root, and produces doubled paths like `babel-cli/babel-cli/src/...`. Prefer absolute paths: `cd <repo-root>/babel-cli`.
3. **Scope searches — unscoped `rg`/Grep over the repo root times out.** Default to `babel-cli/src/` for runtime code, the specific prompt-layer directory for control-plane work. Never search `runs/`, `artifacts/`, `runtime/`, `node_modules/`, or `dist/`. The `.rgignore` file at repo root enforces these exclusions for ripgrep-based tools.
4. **Run the File Size Ratchet check before committing** (it is part of CI and fails late otherwise): run `pwsh tools/check-architectural-budget.ps1` before pushing when you touched large files.
5. **Fanning out subagents that edit files: partition file ownership first.** Concurrent subagents editing the same file (historically `babel-cli/src/agent/chatEngine.ts`) cause "File has been modified since read" errors and merge conflicts. Assign each subagent a disjoint set of files, and confirm the worktree is clean before fan-out.
6. **CI/PR checks via `gh`:** `gh pr view --json statusChecks` is invalid — the field is `statusCheckRollup`. `gh pr checks` exits 8 while checks are *pending*; that is not a failure. A brand-new branch may report "no checks reported" until the first workflow starts — wait and retry rather than diagnosing.
7. **Scrub config regex escaping**: PowerShell/JSON escaping layers can turn `\\b` (word boundary) into literal `b`. When editing scrub rules, verify regex escaping survives the double-layer (JSON parse → PS string).

## Common Task Paths

| Task | Entry point |
|------|------------|
| Run the CLI tests | `cd babel-cli && npm test` |
| Type-check the CLI | `cd babel-cli && npx tsc --noEmit` |
| Build the CLI | `cd babel-cli && npm run build` |
| Validate catalog + audit + domain policy (all 3) | `pwsh tools/validate-all.ps1` |
| Validate prompt catalog | `pwsh tools/validate-catalog.ps1` |
| Audit skill disk drift | `pwsh tools/audit-skill-disk-drift.ps1` |
| Test domain default policy | `pwsh tools/test-domain-default-policy.ps1` |
| Check repo map consistency | `pwsh tools/report-run-consistency.ps1` |
| **Pre-push ratchet check** | `pwsh tools/preflight-ratchet.ps1` |
| **Local CI dry-run (Docker)** | `pwsh tools/ci-dry-run.ps1` |
| Public content policy check | `pwsh tools/check-public-content-policy.ps1 -RepoRoot .` |
| Public secret scan (strict) | `pwsh tools/run-public-secret-scan.ps1 -RepoRoot . -Strict -RequireExternalScanner` |
| Update handoff | `/handoff` |
| Resume from handoff | `/handoff-resume` |

### Testing Discipline (mandatory before push)

From session retrospective analysis: all 10 reviewed sessions deferred testing entirely to CI. This wastes 2-5 minutes per feedback loop vs <30 seconds locally.

- **Before committing CLI changes**: run `cd babel-cli && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test`
- **Before pushing**: run `pwsh tools/preflight-ratchet.ps1` if you touched large files
- **After catalog/routing changes**: run `pwsh tools/validate-all.ps1`
- **Before opening a PR**: run full CI dry-run `pwsh tools/ci-dry-run.ps1`

## Workflow Skills

| Skill | Use when |
|-------|---------|
| `/ratchet-preflight` | Before pushing — check file-size budgets locally |
| `/ci-dry-run` | Before pushing — run CI build+test in Docker |
| `/catalog-validate-all` | After catalog/routing changes — run the validation trio |
| `/branch-stack` | Working on sequential dependent feature branches |
| `/evidence-compile` | Auto-update implementor roadmap status from git history |

## Tool-Use Patterns (learned from session data)

These patterns are observed to be effective in this repo. Prefer them over alternatives:

- **Use `Grep` for content search, not `Bash` + `grep`/`rg`.** Grep produces cleaner context entries without shell overhead. Always provide an explicit `path` to scope the search.
- **Use `Glob` with an explicit `path` parameter.** Unscoped Glob calls timeout on this repo (20s default). Always provide a subdirectory: `babel-cli/src/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, etc.
- **Use `LSP` for TypeScript symbol navigation.** `goToDefinition`, `findReferences`, and `hover` are available and faster than grep-based symbol hunting in `babel-cli/src/`.
- **Use `Read` over `Bash cat`/`head`/`tail` for file inspection.** Read produces cleaner context and avoids shell overhead.
- **Batch sub-agent launches with `parallel()`** when dispatching 3+ independent agents. Sequential one-per-turn launches waste ~30 seconds per agent in round-trip overhead.
- **Use `TaskOutput` with `block:true`** for sub-agent completion handshakes, not SendMessage polling.
- **Use `Monitor` for polling workflows**, not `sleep` in Bash. The tool-use policy blocks sleep+command patterns.

## Pre-PR Checklist

Before opening a PR on this repo:

1. `cd babel-cli && npx tsc --noEmit` — types must pass
2. `cd babel-cli && npm test` — all tests must pass
3. `pwsh tools/check-public-content-policy.ps1 -RepoRoot .` — content policy must pass
4. `pwsh tools/run-public-secret-scan.ps1 -RepoRoot . -Strict -RequireExternalScanner` — zero leaks
5. `pwsh tools/preflight-ratchet.ps1` — file sizes within budget (if you touched large files)
6. Branch from and PR to `main`; use conventional commit prefixes (no `codex/` prefix per memory)

## Repo Cleanup Policy

After catalog or routing changes, run:
- `pwsh tools/validate-catalog.ps1`
- `pwsh tools/audit-skill-disk-drift.ps1`
- `pwsh tools/test-domain-default-policy.ps1` (if domain `default_skill_ids` changed)

After CLI source changes, use the targeted `babel-cli` checks listed in `babel-cli/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`.

**Key rules:**
- Prefer adding indexes, labels, and docs lanes before moving many files.
- **Documentation Co-Evolution**: When adding `.agents/rules/`, ADRs (`docs/adr/`), or archiving historical docs into `docs/archive/`, update `CLAUDE.md` §Quick Traverse and the section `README.md` index in the same change set. Run `pwsh tools/check-architectural-budget.ps1` before committing.
- Do not move `AGENTS.md`, `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `BABEL_BIBLE.md`, model adapters, or startup files without explicit approval.
- Do not delete run evidence, generated artifacts, or snapshots just because they look noisy.
- Generated paths (`runs/`, `artifacts/`, `runtime/`) can contain important evidence — do not delete or flatten without an explicit cleanup task.

For the full documentation lane map, see [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md).

## Context Sync

After substantial runs, update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` if system topology or orchestrator behavior changed.
